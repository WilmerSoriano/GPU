# Reduction

Covers reductions in CUDA.

# Objective

Implement a kernel the performs reduction of a 1D list. The reduction should give the sum of the list.The boundary condition can be handled by filling "identity value (0 for sum)" into the shared memory of the last block when the length is not a multiple of the thread block size. Further assume that the reduction sums of each section generated by individual blocks will be summed up by the CPU.

# Build Instructions

The data and tests can be generated and run in the same way as in previous folder(e.g cmake , build build, sh bash).
