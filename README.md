# CUDA GPU Programming Projects

This repository showcases a collection of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) work, demonstrating how to leverage NVIDIA GPUs for massively parallel computations. By offloading compute‑intensive tasks from the CPU to the GPU’s thousands of lightweight cores, these examples deliver real‑time performance and dramatic speedups.

## What Is CUDA?

CUDA is NVIDIA’s parallel‑computing platform and programming model for general‑purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing. It allows you to write kernels—functions that run on the GPU—launched from host code, and executed by grids of thread‑blocks. Key concepts include:

* **Host vs. Device**: CPU (host) and GPU (device) memory spaces.
* **Kernels**: `__global__` functions executed on the GPU.
* **Threads, Blocks & Grids**: Hierarchical grouping for parallel execution.
* **Memory Hierarchy**: Global, shared, constant, texture memory, and registers.

## Work & Topics Covered

### Mapped Complex Workloads

* Organized problems into grids of thread‑blocks.
* Optimized thread indexing for maximal GPU occupancy.

### Shared‑Memory Tiling & Stencils

* Designed tile‑based and stencil‑kernel algorithms.
* Exploited on‑chip shared memory to minimize global‑memory traffic.

### Memory Coalescing & Bank‑Conflict Avoidance

* Reordered data layouts for fully coalesced memory accesses.
* Eliminated shared‑memory bank conflicts for peak throughput.

### High‑Performance Convolutions

* Built fast 2D/3D convolution routines for image filters and neural‑network layers.
* Used shared‑memory blocking to improve cache reuse.

### Parallel Reductions

* Implemented tree‑based sum, max, and custom reductions.
* Employed `__syncthreads()` for intra‑block synchronization.

### Algorithms

* Developed and optimized parallel sorting and scan techniques.
* Implemented a multi‑pass radix sort using shared memory and warp‑level primitives.
* Explored additional data‑parallel algorithms suited for diverse workloads.

### Profiling & Tuning

* Utilized Nsight and `nvprof` to identify occupancy bottlenecks, register pressure, and instruction‑level inefficiencies.
* Iterated kernel designs for peak performance and resource utilization.

## Benefits Achieved

* **Dramatic Speedups**: Achieved 10×–100× improvements over CPU implementations.
* **Efficient Resource Utilization**: High occupancy with low memory latency.
* **Scalability**: Solutions handle real‑time and large‑scale data processing.
* **Production‑Ready Kernels**: Maintainable code integrate easily into larger pipelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: NVIDIA GPU, CUDA Toolkit installed (nvcc compiler, libraries, and samples).
2. **Build**: Use `nvcc` or your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, Nsight, VS Code).
3. **Run**: Launch sample executables or integrate kernels into your own projects.
